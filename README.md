## Description 

[Watch a video of the Employee Tracker in action!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16aKbDJ5Noy66jGPjZ7nOCOuVsKoxSqwm/view)

I built this employee tracker so that a person could quickly and easily see all the employees in a company, who they are, what they do, what department they are in, and who their manager is (or maybe they are the manager! It shows that also).  Also with this employee tracker, a user can add new employees (including name, role, salary, and who they will work for).  A user can also add roles, and departments also.
